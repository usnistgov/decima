 * Implementations of this interface can be used to build an {@link AssessmentResults} based on
 * results reported to the builder during an assessment. An {@link AssessmentResultBuilder} is used
 * by the various {@link Assessment} implementations to track a collection of {@link TestResult}
 * instances generated during the assessment process. new TestResult instances can be registered by
 * calling the {@link #addTestResult(Assessment, Document, String, TestResult)} method. Once all
 * assessments are completed, an {@link AssessmentResults} instance can be generated using the
 * {@link #build(RequirementsManager)} method. Before calling the
 * {@link DefaultAssessmentResultBuilder#build(RequirementsManager)}, callers must first call the
 * {@link DefaultAssessmentResultBuilder#end()} method to designate the end of the assessment run.
 * <p>
 * This interface supports marking specific derived requirements as tested by calling the
 * {@link #assignTestStatus(Assessment, Document, String, TestState)} method. This can be useful to
 * ensure that the derived requirement {@link ResultStatus} does not get evaluated as
 * {@link ResultStatus#NOT_TESTED} when a TestResult has not been generated for the derived
 * requirement because there was no failure to report using the
 * {@link #addTestResult(Assessment, Document, String, TestResult)} method.
