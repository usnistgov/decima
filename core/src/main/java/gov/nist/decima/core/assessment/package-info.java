/**
 * This package is the core of Decima providing assessment functions for evaluating a series of
 * tests grouped into assessments that check the well-formedness and content-completeness of a
 * document instance.
 * <p>
 * This package supports a pattern of evaluation where a document is evaluated by executing one or
 * more {@link gov.nist.decima.core.assessment.Assessment Assessment} instances. The document
 * instance is represented by a {@link gov.nist.decima.core.document.Document} object instance. This
 * assessment pattern is handled by an implementation of an
 * {@link gov.nist.decima.core.assessment.AssessmentExecutor AssessmentExecutor}.
 * <p>
 * The following example illustrates the typical way of setting up an assessment execution:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * List<Assessment> assessments = new ArrayList<>(2);
 * Assessment assessment1 = new ...
 * assessments.add(assessment1);
 * Assessment assessment2 = new ...
 * assessments.add(assessment2);
 * 
 * Document document = new ...
 * 
 * BasicAssessmentExecutor executor = new BasicAssessmentExecutor(assessments);
 * AssessmentResults results = executor.execute(document);
 * 
 * // do something with the results
 * }
 * </pre>
